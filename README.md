In this week assignment I create 3 classes. First one is a class of randomizing attribute. Second class
is for drawing a normal polygon. Its attribute is side_num which is determined in if-else in main.
The third class is a more complex polygon which has 2 smaller polygon in the middle.

I determined the number of polygon to be 30.

What I've successfully implemented is art 1,2,3, and 4. Others than that, I've met an obstacle by not knowing
how to reduce the ratio and make the smaller one to be positioned in the middle. So, some of the polygon's
position is not quite right.

For art 4 and 8, I set the polygon size to be 0 and if the polygon size is 0 it will randomize the number
between 3 and 5.

I used if-else to display all the drawing. For art 9, I don't know if 2 classes cam be randomized. So, I 
used number 1 and 2 as a represent for them.
